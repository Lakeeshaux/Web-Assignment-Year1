	<h1>About Sea Side Park</h1>
	<p class="about_text">
		Sea Side Park Hotel is the most extensive and perhaps even the most beautiful resort on the island.
		Here you can enjoy beach walks of up to two kilometres - for example to Crab Shack, where you can
		watch dolphins jump and the sun set while you enjoy a drink and a snack. Or you can sit on the terrace
		of your villa overlooking the sea and watch a giant manta ray drift past.
		At Sea Side Park Hotel you are spoilt for choice stylish villas, a variety of restaurants and a wide range of 
		activities offered by our diving and water sports centre. And of course there's also a wonderful spa, 
		where you can welcome the sun as you practise yoga. Children are offered their own range of memorable 
		adventures to experience. Yes, Sea Side Park Hotel makes people happy. We look forward to welcoming you!
